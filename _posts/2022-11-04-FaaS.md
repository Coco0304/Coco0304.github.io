title: Optimizing the Serverless Workload at Cloud

In this project, we implement the FaaS management policy proposed by the paper [Serverless in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing the Serverless Workload at a Large Cloud Provider](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/shahrad) and simulate the cloud environment for evaluating the policy performance. The simulation is based on Azure 2019 invocation data. The key idea of the policy is to unload the application code from the memory for a pre-warm window of time and load the code again for a keep-alive window of time for the next invocation. When the application code is already in the memory, its functions can be launched quickly, which is called a warm start. On the other hand, in the cold start, it takes more time to access the code in the persistent storage and start the function. However, keeping the application code in the memory at all times can be prohibitively expensive, especially for short and infrequent applications. Therefore, the trade-off between performance and resource cost is necessary.
