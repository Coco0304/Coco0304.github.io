# What is Stackelberg Competition?

> Stackelberg competition is a model of strategic interactions in which one firm is the leader and the others are followers. The leader firm makes its decision about output or price first, and then the other firms make their decisions based on the leader's decision. The leader firm has more information and can use this information to its advantage to maximize its profit. The followers, on the other hand, must react to the leader's decision and try to maximize their own profit based on the leader's choice. This model is named after the economist Heinrich von Stackelberg, who first proposed it in 1934.

# 二次电池的技术特性是多少?

> 二次电池的技术特性因不同的类型而有所不同。例如，铅酸电池（如蓄电池）的技术特性包括电压约为 2V，比能量约为 50-80Wh/kg，容量衰减速率约为 1-3%/月。锂离子电池（如手机电池）的技术特性包括电压约为 3.6V，比能量约为 150-250Wh/kg，容量衰减速率约为 3-5%/月。这些特性都会因不同的制造商而有所不同，在选择电池时应注意比较各家生产商的技术特性。
