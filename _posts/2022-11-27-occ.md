This is a project of NTU CE7454: Deep Learning for Data Science. The report is [here](http://siyue-zhang.github.io/images/HPE_with_Occlusion.pdf).

Human Pose Estimation (HPE) has been popular in the computer vision community. Various deep learning models have been proposed to achieve superior performance on HPE. However, if parts of the objects are occluded, their performances would degrade due to the loss of context and semantics. Towards this problem, this work proposes an artificial occlusion transformation to imitate in-the-wild occlusions. Its use is tested on three well-known HPE models reproduced by ourselves, i.e., SimpleBaseline, HRNet, and ViTPose. We first show how their performances have been affected when presented with occluded images. Experiments were then conducted to investigate the optimal occlusion settings. Finally, we concluded that fine-tuning images with occlusions could boost the robustness of the model.
