This post summarizes key ideas in the conference paper "[Blockchain for 5G: Opportunities and Challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9024627)".

# 5G Primary Features

- User peak data rate of 10 Gbps
- 1 million devices per square kilometer
- 10 Tbps per square kilometer
- 1 millionsecond latency
- Network Function Virtulization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN)

# Opportunities by Blockchain

## 5G Infrastructure Crowdsourcing

## 5G Infrastructure Sharing

* National Roaming
* Spectrum Sharing

## Internaltional Roaming

## Network Slicing


## Management and Authentication of mMTC and uRLLC

* Massive Machine Communication (mMTC)
* Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (uRLLC)


# Challenges

## Scalability

## Smart Contracts

* How to transform existing smart contracts into smart contracts for 5G ecosystem? (design problem)
* Legality of smart contract deployment.
* Security of smart contract code: bugs and vulnerability.
* How to upgrade or patch published smart contracts?

## Standardization and Regulations

## Transaction and Cloud Infrastructure Costs

Costs to host blockchain nodes

## Data Privacy

No personal data shall be stored in blockchain, only has pointers of that information

## Interoperability

New technologies of 5G work in a different fashion:
* mmWave
* Small cells
* mMIMO
* Full duplex
* SDN
* Beamforming

## Naming, Registration, and Reputation
