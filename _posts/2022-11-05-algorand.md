This post takes note of key ideas in Algorand documents.

Algorand is a truly **democratic** and **efficient** way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not “fork” with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) **message-passing Byzantine agreement**. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a **money platform**.

Algorand, because we use algorithmic randomness to select, based on the ledger constructed so far, a set of **verifiers** who are in charge of constructing the next block of valid transactions. Naturally, we ensure that such selections are provably immune from manipulations and unpredictable until the last minute, but also that they ultimately are universally clear.

One notable property of Algorand is that its transaction history may fork only with very small probability (e.g., one in a trillion, that is, or even 10^−18).

# Bitcoin's Assumption and Technical Problems:

## Assumption: Honest Majority of Computational Power

Bitcoin assumes that no malicious entity (nor a coalition of coordinated malicious entities) controls the majority of the computational power devoted to block generation. Such an entity, in fact, would be able to modify the blockchain, and thus re-write the payment history.

## Technical Problem 1: Computational Waste

Bitcoin’s proof-of-work approach to block generation requires an extraordinary amount of computation. This amount of computation would greatly increase, should significantly more users join the system.

## Technical Problem 2: Concentration of Power

For computing a new block with an ordinary computer, the expected cost of the necessary electricity to power the computation exceeds the expected reward. Only using pools of specially built computers (that do nothing other than “mine new blocks”), one might expect to make a profit by generating new blocks. Accordingly, today there are, de facto, two disjoint classes of users: ordinary users, who only make payments, and specialized mining pools, that only search for new blocks.

## Technical Problem 3: Ambiguity

Its latest portion often forks.  Only after several blocks have been added to the chain, can one be reasonably sure that the first k + 3 blocks will be the same for all users. Thus, one cannot rely right away on the payments contained in the last block of the chain. It is more prudent to wait and see whether the block becomes sufficiently deep in the blockchain and thus sufficiently stable.
