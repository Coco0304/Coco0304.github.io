This post summarizes key ideas in documents of Algorand.

Algorand is a truly **democratic** and **efficient** way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not “fork” with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) **message-passing Byzantine agreement**. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a **money platform**.
