Strategic interation (i.e., Game) Describing Components:
1. Players
2. Actions
3. Information (what players know when they act)
4. Outcomes
5. Preferences (rank of outcomes)

Game tree (decision tree)
* Decision nodes (belong to only 1 person)
* Terminal nodes
* Branch (each node can be reached by only 1 path)
* Outcomes
* Information set (a collection of decision nodes)

Strategy is a complete **contingent plan** for a player in the game. A strategy must specify each action player will take at each decision node or information set. One information set has only one action.

Normal (Strategic) Form Representation of Games

**Belief** of a player is his/her assessment about the strategies of others in the game. 

**Mixed strategies** is probability distribution over the set of pure strategies available to a player. Pure strategy is the strategy probability equal to 1.

Rationality: players behave consistently according to their preference (e.g., maximizing their own payoffs, minimizing opponent's payoff, etc.). 

Common Knowledge: game structure is the common knowledge among players. 

A strategy profile is efficient if there is no other profile existing is more efficient (all players get equal or higher payoffs).

**Contract**: an agreement about behavior that is intended to be enforced. Contract is self-enforced if players have incentive to abide by the terms of the contract. Contract is externally-enforced if players motivated externally by a judge or arbitrator.

Reputation of the player can impact the strategy. 

* Defendent: the person breaches the contract
* Plantiff: the person abide the contract
