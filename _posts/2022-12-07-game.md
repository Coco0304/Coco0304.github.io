Strategic interation (i.e., Game) Describing Components:
1. Players
2. Actions
3. Information (what players know when they act)
4. Outcomes
5. Preferences (rank of outcomes)

Game tree (decision tree)
* Decision nodes (belong to only 1 person)
* Terminal nodes
* Branch (each node can be reached by only 1 path)
* Outcomes
* Information set (a collection of decision nodes)

Strategy is a complete **contingent plan** for a player in the game. A strategy must specify each action player will take at each decision node or information set. One information set has only one action.
